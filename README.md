### Project Description
- The goal of this project was to practice our data analysis skills and test our machine learning knowledge by analysing a large dataset and build a model able to predict the outcome of a target variable 

- Given the nature of the dataset used, this analysis aims to outline some possible reasons for patient no-showing at the scheduled appointments 

- The commands assume a basic understanding of the Pandas, Matplotlib and scikit-learn
libraries.

### Data
- For the purpose of this analysis, the [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/noshowappointments) used contains about 100k entries related to medical appointments from patients in Brazil and 14 variables regarding their conditions and wether or not they showed up to the appointment.


 Define problem 
- No-show rate for Brazilian medical appointmentsis 20.19% 

❑ Define project goal: 
- Produce a model able to predict the likelihood of a patient to show-up to his/her medical appointment 

❑ Frame the problem:
- 20,19% of the medical patients in Brazil do not show up to their scheduled appointments, resulting in severe operational inefficiency and costs to their health system

❑ Define performance metric

-  ???

❑ Look for approaches to similar problems:
- Alternative Kernels in Kaggle

❑ List assumptions made so far:
- Gender, ScheduledDay, AppointmentDay, Age, Neighbourhood, Scholarship and SMS_received seem to be the most important features when in comes to predict the outcome of No_Show- 

### Workflow
- Step 1: Blablabla
- Step 2: Blablabla
- Step 3: Blablabla

### Results
* show_no_show.csv - with all the data collected from Kaggle
* main.ipynb - containing all the code that built the project
* figures - containing the product of all the visualization that supported the project

### Deliverables
* Clean data set containing all patients info, including wether or not they attended their medical appointments
* ML model able to predict wether there's going to be a Show-Up/No-Show based on the patient's features
